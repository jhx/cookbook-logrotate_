0.2.0 / 2014-01-19
------------------

- `BREAK` require `logrotate` cookbook ~> v1.4.0 | [#32][]

  (technically, this isn't a breaking change, but integration tests will fail with older cookbook version because we specify a non-default file mode)

- `NEW` add unit tests (via chefspec) | [#15][]
- `NEW` add syntax checks (via knife) | [#14][]
- `NEW` add support for travis-ci | [#13][]
- `NEW` add cookbook lint checks (via foodcritic), fix flagged items | [#11][] [#12][]
- `NEW` add specification files for ruby version | [#10][]
- `IMPROVE` default recipe now includes other recipe(s)
